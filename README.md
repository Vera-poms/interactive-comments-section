## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Tailwind CSS](https://https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles


### What I learned

This is a CRUD App so I learnt how to create new comments, add replies to comments,delete a reply and making updates to comments.

Using Reactjs, Tailwindcss and motion, I designed and made the original design come to live for a better user experience.

### Continued development

I would like to do the dark mode for the version this already created one.
